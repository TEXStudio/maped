Maped
-----
Map editor for XS3K

About
-----
Maped was developed as an in-house tool to ease level design in xs3k.
A manual with instructions on how to use the program is available in the
doc directory. Note that this tool was hacked together in short time to 
serve a specific purpose. The code is no longer maintained.

The program data files are compressed and placed under the bin directory
(data.tar.gz). In order to use the program, you need to uncompress
the data tarball and place the contents under the same directory as the 
executable.
